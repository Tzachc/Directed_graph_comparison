# Directed_graph_comparison
Directed weighted graph implement in python in order to make a comparison with out Java project and Networkx lib.

# About our project
this project is a follow-up project to the previous one's.
this project is build about 3 main algorithms: shortest_path, connected component and connected components.

the goal for this project is to implement an directed weighted graph (data structre), in python, and then make a comparison
with our java project (compar the Run times and results), also we make compar with python Networkx graph lib.

# How the graph is build?
in our project there is "DiGraph" class, that implement the graph itself.
in additional to DiGraph, there are also NodeData and EdgeData classes that represent a Node and Edge in our graph. 

* DiGraph:
